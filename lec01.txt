======================

Every file in file system has permissions.
Permission template structure:

permission              action on file            			action on directory
==========				==============						==================
* r(read)       		read file content(cat)            	read directory (ls)
* w(write)				change file content(vi)				create files in(touch)
* x(execute)			execute a file 						enter the directory(cd)

* "chmod u+x <filename>"  - change permission such that user can execute
* "chown user:group file" - set ownership

xxx - bitwise word that decides the permission of the file (111 = 7    - provides r,w,x permission)

* b  	- block (hard drive)
* c 	- character device
* s 	- socket
